# Python-Decorators-and-tf.function-in-TensorFlow
In this repo, we'll talk about "Python Decorators and @tf.function in TensorFlow", a comprehensive guide on how to optimize and accelerate deep learning models using decorators and the @tf.function decorator in TensorFlow.

Decorators are a powerful Python feature that allow for adding additional functionality to functions or methods, such as logging, caching, or performance optimizations, without modifying their code. In the context of TensorFlow, decorators can be used to optimize the execution of computational graphs, making the models more efficient and faster.

The @tf.function decorator in TensorFlow is a specific decorator that converts Python functions into graph-based computations, which can be optimized and executed more efficiently. It is particularly useful for improving the performance of TensorFlow models during inference and training.


The repository includes detailed explanations, practical examples, performance comparisons, and documentation that provide a comprehensive guide for leveraging decorators and @tf.function in TensorFlow. The codebase is well-organized, documented, and follows best coding practices, making it easy to understand
